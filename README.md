## DISCLAIMER ##

This software isn't implementing a official solution from whatsapp, since they DO NOT support any kind of bulk feature. 
Additionaly, we have browser agent implemented, in order to not be caught in the process. However, there is no such thing as uncrackable code. 
Untill now, it is working fine with api.web of WA, but it could need adjustments based on WA future updates.
